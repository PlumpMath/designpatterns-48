# Design Patterns

This is where I come to implement design patterns with the intention of driving them deeper into muscle memory.

# Disclaimer

It is highly likely that you will find examples contained inside this repo with code that exists elsewhere on the web, most notably right now from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). Or, they will be some modified version of what exists on Wikipedia (or other sources). I'm making a good effort to document where code samples come from, as well as sources I look to and seek inspiration from. So if you see something that looks familiar, it very well may be. And you should check the README.md's for further information, or look at the commits. I'm likely to document things in both or either places.
